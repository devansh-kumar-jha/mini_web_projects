# Mini Projects using HTML, CSS and Javascript
These program files contain basic mini projects using HTML, CSS and Javascript.
These are made to get basic familiarity with all the components of Web Development and these will be finally
used to make a website which will be hosted on my IITK CC ID server later on.

This would be my first web development exercise :)
